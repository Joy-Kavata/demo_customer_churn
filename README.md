### Telco Customer Churn Prediction & Risk Segmentation
A machine learning application designed to quantify customer retention risk and predict churn probabilities using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.

Live Interactive App: 

## Project Overview
Data Processing & EDA: Cleaned customer demographics, contract types, and service usage features.
Model Evaluation: Benchmarked classifiers using Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC metrics to optimize for retention strategy.
Interactive Dashboard: Deployed a Streamlit UI displaying real-time predictions, annual value at risk, and key feature weights.

### Key Insights & Drivers
Primary Predictors: TotalCharges, MonthlyCharges, and tenure account for over 54% of model predictive power.
High-Risk Segment: Customers on month-to-month contracts using electronic check payments exhibit the highest overall churn rate.
Risk Tiers: Automatically categorizes customers into High (🔴), Medium (🟡), and Low (🟢) risk buckets for automated retention workflows.

### Repository Structure
app.py: Streamlit web interface and layout code.
churn_random_forest_model.pkl: Serialized Random Forest machine learning model.
